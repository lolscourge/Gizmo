# Gizmo

A project for Maggie

Gizmo is a small GUI chatbot that:

- Can be activated using a wake word using the porcupine wake word API
- Listens for speech input
- Has a display that reacts based on the input
- Converts the speech input into text
- Fetches a response from the OpenAI conversional API
- Converts the response back to speech using Google Speech-to-Text
- Print outs and speaks the response in the display

It's my first python project and frankly, it was a reach. The code is probably all over the place and can 100% be improved upon, but it works!
